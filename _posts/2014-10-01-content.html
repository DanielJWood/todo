        <p>Changes in climate create diverse challenges across the U.S. energy system. Some energy infrastructure assets have already suffered damage or disruption in services from a variety of climate-related impacts, such as higher temperatures, rising sea levels, and more severe weather events. In the absence of concerted action to improve resilience, energy system vulnerabilities pose a threat to America’s national security, energy security, economic well-being, and quality of life. </p>
        <p>Building climate change resilience into our energy infrastructure planning is a challenging and complex undertaking. Planning horizons can span several decades (the typical service life of most energy assets), associated investments can extend into the billions of dollars, and relevant technologies can change rapidly. Some climate change impacts may trigger cascading effects on natural resources, energy demand, and supply chains. Challenges are compounded when addressing climate risks at the regional or local level, where climate change projections are subject to less certainty than at the national scale. </p>
        <p>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has proactively launched numerous initiatives to support and facilitate energy sector climate preparedness and resilience at national, regional, and local levels. In addition to enhancing resilience to climate change, these actions may also have co-benefits that accommodate non-climate resilience needs (e.g., aging infrastructure, cybersecurity, physical attacks, geomagnetic storms). To assist infrastructure owners and utility planners, DOE has compiled this report on region-specific energy vulnerabilities to climate change (see Figure ES-1) and current resilience solutions.</p>

    "summary":"Hawaii and Puerto Rico share many similarities in their energy systems, including reliance on imported petroleum and other fuels. In both of the island regions, projected sea level rise and hurricane-driven storm surge threaten ports and other essential coastal energy infrastructure with flooding, wave damage, and erosion, while hurricane winds pose a danger to structures and power lines (DOE 2013, Murakami et al. 2013, PRCCC 2013, USGCRP 2014). Higher temperatures reduce the efficiency of oil-fired and other thermoelectric power plants, significantly restricting electricity supply if such losses are not offset by reduced demand or supplies added elsewhere in the system (DOE 2013). Other U.S. islands in the Pacific and in the Caribbean are not separately examined in this report but are likely to have similar climate impacts and resilience solutions as Hawaii and Puerto Rico",

    "summary":"Northern latitudes, including all of Alaska, are warming faster than temperate regions, and the permafrost underlying much of Alaska's interior and northern coastlines is at risk of thawing (USGCRP 2014). Thawing permafrost causes underlying land to shift and soften. These structural changes can potentially damage the foundations of pipelines as well as roads and airstrips used for fuel shipments to Alaska's remote rural communities (USGCRP 2014). Thawing permafrost and declining sea ice have already accelerated the erosion of coastlines in rural communities, resulting in damaged or destroyed infrastructure for fuel transfer and storage (Alaska AAG 2010, DOE 2013, USGCRP 2014). Warmer temperatures are likely to shorten the season during which ice roads can be used to reach oil and gas operations in the North Slope (DOE 2013). Alaska's extensive energy assets may also be vulnerable to projected increases in wildfire (USGCRP 2014).",

Warmer temperatures and less mountain snowpack will shift peak streamflow in the region from summer toward spring (BPA 2011, CIG 2009, DOE 2012, Doppelt 2009, USGCRP 2014). Meanwhile, warmer temperatures will likely increase electricity demand for cooling in the summer, when available hydropower generation is reduced (BPA 2011, DOE 2012, DOE 2013, USGCRP 2014). Warmer and drier summers may also increase the threat of wildfires, which have the potential to disrupt electricity transmission (DOE 2013, USGCRP 2014).",

More frequent and severe heat waves are likely to amplify demand for cooling energy (NOAA 2013, Sathaye et al. 2012, USGCRP 2014). Higher temperatures and reduced water availability may limit the ability of natural gas-fired, coal-fired, and other thermoelectric power plants in the region to meet demand (DOE 2013, Sathaye et al. 2012). Hydropower resources will be affected by reductions in streamflow and shifts in streamflow timing (AEG and Cubed 2005, Cayan et al. 2013, NOAA 2013, USGCRP 2014). Electricity transmission lines essential to connecting remote generation assets to demand centers are vulnerable to projected increases in wildfire as forests and shrub lands become drier (DOE 2013, Sathaye et al. 2012, USGCRP 2014)",

Summer heat waves could also damage railroad tracks and are likely to reduce thermoelectric power plant and transmission line capacity (DOE 2013, USGCRP 2014).

Projected increases in the intensity of Atlantic hurricanes and associated rainfall, combined with rising global sea levels and subsiding coastlines, escalate the risk of coastal flooding and wind damage to many of these assets (DOE 2013, USGCRP 2014, DOE 2015). Heat waves and higher temperatures are also projected for the region, increasing electricity demand for cooling while reducing the generation capacity of thermoelectric power plants and the transmission capacity of power lines (DOE 2013, NOAA 2013, USGCRP 2014).

Energy-related infrastructure, including roads, railroads, and electric grid equipment, may also be at increased risk of damage due to flooding, as heavy precipitation events are projected to occur more frequently (DOE 2013, NOAA 2013, USGCRP 2014). Increased risk of floods and droughts may disrupt fuel transport on inlands waterways.
